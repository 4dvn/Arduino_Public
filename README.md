# Arduino
Arduino-based experiments and MIDI controllers. 

These sketches are designed to be used with Arduino sensors connected to an Arduino Uno. Connect the Arduino to a PC via USB. 
Hairless MIDI serial and LoopBe need to be installed on the PC. Hairless MIDI deals with the serial data. LoopBe allows this data to be fed to music software.
